Description: The fastest pure-Python PEG parser I can muster
  Parsimonious aims to be the fastest arbitrary-lookahead parser written in pure Pythonâ€”and
  the most usable. It's based on parsing expression grammars (PEGs), which means you feed it a
  simplified sort of EBNF notation. Parsimonious was designed to undergird a MediaWiki parser
  that wouldn't take 5 seconds or a GB of RAM to do one page, but it's applicable to all sorts
  of languages.
